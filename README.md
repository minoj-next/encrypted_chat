# Secure Encrypted Chat Client-Server

This project provides a secure and encrypted chat communication system between clients and a central server. It uses Python and the Fernet encryption library for end-to-end message security.

## Prerequisites

- Python 3.x
- Python packages: cryptography

## Getting Started

1. Clone this repository to your local machine:
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/encrypted_chat.git
2. navigate to the project directory
 cd encrypted_chat
3. Modify the server.py file details
copy your local ip address and paste it in server.py file ( open server.py file with = mousepad server.py )
4. run the server.py
python server.py
5. now you will find encryption key and server listening status
6. now open another terminal and navigate to encrypted_chat directory
7. open the client.py file = mousepad client.py
8. replace the existing key with the generated key from server
9. run the client.py
    python client.py
10. now exchange messages securely from server to client
