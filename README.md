# Secure Encrypted Chat Client-Server

This project provides a secure and encrypted chat communication system between clients and a central server. It uses Python and the Fernet encryption library for end-to-end message security.

## Prerequisites

- Python 3.x
- Python packages: cryptography

## Getting Started

1. Clone this repository to your local machine:
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/encrypted_chat.git
2. navigate to the project directory
 cd encrypted_chat
3. Modify the server.py file details
copy your local ip address and paste it in server.py file ( open server.py file with = mousepad server.py )
4. run the server.py
python server.py
5. now you will find encryption key and server listening status
6. now open another terminal and navigate to encrypted_chat directory
7. open the client.py file = mousepad client.py
8. replace the existing key with the generated key from server and paste same ip address that you placed in server.py
9. run the client.py
    python client.py
10. now exchange messages securely from server to client

Usage
Start the server and client, then follow the on-screen prompts to exchange encrypted messages.
